    Olivia started programming in high school out of a curiosity for how
    computers work. However it was the clever and "neat" design of various
    sequencing assays she learned about in high school that grabbed her
    interest more strongly.

    Under the suggestion of <a href="https://cs.colby.edu/srtaylor/">Dr.
      Stephanie Taylor <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a>, she switched
    her major from Biochemistry to Interdisciplinary Computation and Biology
    (IC-Biology) major to merge her two interests. In 2015, Olivia graduated
    as the first IC-Biology student from Colby College.

    After graduation she was hired by <a href="https://cherrylab.stanford.edu/"> Dr. Mike Cherry <i
        class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> at Stanford University to
    work as an Associate Biocuration Scientist for the <a href="https://www.yeastgenome.org/"><em>Saccharomyces</em>
      Genome Database (SGD) <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a>. During her time at SGD, Olivia started to
    recognize the barriers and appreciate the demand of user-friendly access to both data and
    the tools for analyzing them. Under the direct management of Dr. Stacia
    Engel, Olivia was exposed to a broad range of yeast genetics topics and
    was able to zero in on the variety of genomics-based studies as areas
    she wished to dig deeper into.

    So she applied to graduate programs and eventually landed in the labs of
    <a href="https://pughlab.mbg.cornell.edu/">Dr. Frank Pugh <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> and <a
      href="https://williamkmlai.github.io/">Dr. William Lai <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> at Cornell
    University where she works on bioinformatic tool development and investigating transcription initiation mechanisms
    in yeast.
